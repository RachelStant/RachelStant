### Hi there 👋

#### Welcome to my page!
I'm Rachel, a front-end developer in training from Philadelphia, PA. 🔔 🏛️ <br>
- After several years of experimenting with different programming languages and building mobile applications, I decided to dive into the world of web development, which I have become extremely interested in. <br>
- My focus now is learning the basics and beyond of JavaScript, HTML, CSS and React so I can create my own dynamic web pages that solve problems and make a positive impact. <br>
- I am challenging myself to dig deep into all aspects of web development and to refine my analytical and problem solving skills.

#### Skills: REACT / JS / HTML / CSS & SCSS / BOOTSTRAP / SWIFT
